# FaceBlur
A live facial blurring system. 
This project was built using Python and the haar cascades
This project should be used (tested) in a well-lit area.
Each of the .py files has different characteristics of blurring based on a few changed parameters such as the intensity and shape of the Gaussian blur after detection.
Feel free to clone and edit the various blur variables as you see fit.
